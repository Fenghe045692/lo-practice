1. What's recursion
     When we write a method for solving a particular problem, one of teh basic design techniques is to break the task into smaller subtasks.
     so that when the subtasks resolved then the recursion function will call itself until reach the base case.

     When to write recursion function make sure
       1. base case
       2. endless loop

2. mergeSort and quickSort will use recursion
